Who We Are
Airetris GRC is a specialist governance, risk, and compliance advisory firm.

We work with boards, executives, investors, and regulators when trust, ethics, or controls are under pressure—and when governance must stand up to scrutiny.

Our work sits at the intersection of law, behavior, and real‑world practice.
Not theory. Not templates. Judgment.

Our Experience
Airetris brings decades of global experience across:

Legal and corporate governance

Compliance, risk, and ESG

Cybersecurity, data protection, and AI governance

Investigations, audits, and regulatory enforcement

IPOs, M&A, and complex transactions

Our perspective is shaped by thousands of real cases across jurisdictions and industries—where decisions carry legal, financial, and reputational consequences.
